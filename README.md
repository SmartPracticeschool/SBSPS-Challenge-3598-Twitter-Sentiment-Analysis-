**INTRODUCTION:

The ongoing pandemic has affected lives of millions around the world. It has been observed that people have used social media to give voice to their emotions. In order to analyze them, Sentiment Analysis on tweets is probably the best way to understand the ongoing circumstances. Based on the tweets on Covid19, our team aspires to build dashboards for daily monitoring of the results.


**PROCEDURE:

1. Daily tweets were collected, preprocessed maintained in the csv. Then the tweets were labelled as positive,negative and neutral score using Textblob and trained in the LogisticRegression model.

2.The monthly data collection is used to update the analysis on the dashboard.The trending news topics corresponding keywords are used to classify tweets. 
Keywords: COVID-19, SocialDistancing, Lockdown, WorkFromHome.

3.Information like user engagements are taken into account and maintained in the csv.

4. Analysing sentiment levels: The sentiment level is calculated as per the following formulae:
                Tweets with the certain sentiment / Total tweets
This help us to submarize the overall reaction.

5.The final results on the dashboard depicts trends monthwise.
 
**FUTURE SCOPE
