The ongoing pandemic has affected lives of millions around the world. It has been observed that people have used social media to give voice to their emotions. In order to analyze them, Sentiment Analysis on tweets is probably the best way to understand the ongoing circumstances. Based on the tweets on Covid19, our team aspires to build dashboards for daily monitoring of the results.

Steps
1. Firstly the dataset is to be trained for the model, then calculate the positive,negative and neutral score using Textblob.

2.The data collection is used to update the analysis on the dashboard.The trending news topics corresponding keywords will be used to classify tweets. 
Keywords: COVID-19, SocialDistancing, Lockdown, WorkFromHome.

3.Information like user engagements are taken into account and maintained in the csv

4. Analysing sentiment levels: The sentiment level is calculated as per the following formulae:
                Tweets with the certain sentiment / Total tweets
This helped us to submarize the overall reaction.

5.The final results on the dashboard depicts daily trends.
 
Future Scope
We also plan to include 
1. the  misinformation detection.
2. improvising scope of language as the model is restricted to English language.
